## Intro
- ES6 vs Javascript
- ES1 to 7 are standards for JavaScript
- ES5 is widely supported by browsers and therefore is safe to use
- ES6 is not widely supported by browsers
- We use Babel to convert ES6 to ES5 for browsers to use

## forEach.js - The 'forEach' helper
- It is used to replace "for loop"
- We should avoid using "for loop" because many logics on a single line of code can create challenges for other developers to read and understand
- forEach helper passes the element in an array to the Iterator function
- Reason for using forEach:
...1.Reduce the amount of code
...1.Reduce the logic written
