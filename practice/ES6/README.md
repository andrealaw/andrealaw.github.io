## Intro
- ES6 vs Javascript
- ES1 to 7 are standards for JavaScript
- ES5 is widely supported by browsers and therefore is safe to use
- ES6 is not widely supported by browsers
- We use Babel to convert ES6 to ES5 for browsers to use

## forEach.js - The 'forEach' helper
- It is used to replace "for loop"
- We should avoid using "for loop" because many logics on a single line of code can create challenges for other developers to read and understand
- forEach helper passes the element in an array to the Iterator function
- Reason for using forEach:
  1. Reduce the amount of code
  2. Reduce the logic written

## map.js - The 'map' helper
- Use frequently in client-side frameworks like Angular and React
- Commonly used for printing a list of items on the screens, e.g. blog posts, comments

## filter.js - The 'filter' helper
- Common use cases: 
  1. Filter out a search on a search page, e.g. size and colour of shoes, 
  2. Filter out categories of items selling on a supermarket's online store
  3. Filter out comments for a specific post
  4. Find the rejected values and print them

## find.js - The 'find' helper
- Replace the iterator functions
- Do not need to use a "break" to stop the loop
- Find and stop at the first matched item
- Use this to look for a particular object
