# A Summary of JavaScript practice

# Basic JavaScript
- **basic-algebra.js**: Demonstrate the use of console.time for measurement and comparison of execution time required by addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

# Basic Algorithm Scripting
- **fibonacci.js**: 3 functions that each takes a number n and returns an array containing a Fibonacci sequence of length n
- **is-prime.js**: A function to check if a number is prime
- **palindromes.js**: A function that returns true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
- **reverse-an-array.js**: Use reverse to reverse the array variable and assign it to newArray

## Advanced Algorithm Scripting
- **validate-us-telephone-numbers.js**: A function that returns true if the passed string is a valid US phone number.
- **record-collection.js**: A function that updates a JSON object of a musical album collection.
- **symmetric-difference.js**: A function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of the symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of the provided arrays.
- **exact-change.js**: A cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that returns change in coin and bills, sorted from the highest to the lowest value, according to cash in the drawer.
- **inventory-update.js**: Compare and update the inventory stored in a 2D array against a second 2D array of a fresh delivery.

- **make-a-person.js**: An object constructor of a person with methods to get and update its first name, last name or full name.
- **map-the-debris.js**: A function that returns a new array transforming the element's average altitude into their orbital periods.
- **pairwise.js**: A function that takes an array arr, finds its element pairs whose sum equals to the second argument arg and return the sum of their indices.
