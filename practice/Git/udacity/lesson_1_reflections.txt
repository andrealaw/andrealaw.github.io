Reflections for Lesson 1


Q.How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?
————————————————————————————————
Diff shows changes in codes between two files easily with line numbers.
It shortens the time for fixing bugs.


Q.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
————————————————————————————————
I can restore the changes and restore the codes if needed easily. 
I can have a better management over the codes.
I can save time on creating manual copies.

Q.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
————————————————————————————————
Pros:
-More flexible
-Easier to find and understand
Cons:
-Risk of forgetting to commit changes
-A clear picture of changes required is needed


Q.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
————————————————————————————————
Systems are designed for different purposes.

Git is designed for programming with multiple interrelated files,
which changes in one file may affect and other files and cause errors unexpectedly.

Other version control systems are not designed for programming,
and they are mainly for managing separate files only.


Q.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
————————————————————————————————
Running git log will show a list of the recent commits with information about them, including commit IDs. 

Running git diff followed by two commit IDs will compare the two versions of the code in those commits.


Q.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
————————————————————————————————
I can always go back to the previous version with no breaks.
I can compare commits to find out lines that cause the breaks.
I can try to make big changes without fear of breaking everything.


Q.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
————————————————————————————————
For saving versions of my files, like this one.
