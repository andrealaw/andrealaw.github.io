Q.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
---
A hidden file .git at the current working directory.
It allows git to create an empty repository for commits.

Q.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
---
Staging area is used to store files to be committed in the same commit, which is also the next commit.
Working directory is the directory where all working files are stored, whether
they are staged or committed.
Repository is a directory at Git, which stores commits(different versions) of selected files from my computer.

Staging area allows users to have a clearer picture of files modified for the logical change of the commits.
It also save space for duplicated copies of the same file that has no change across the commits.
